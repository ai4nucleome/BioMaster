This step will utilize the provided SNP data (bed, bim, and fam files) to detect continuous stretches of homozygous genotypes, which can indicate autozygosity and levels of inbreeding. PLINK's --homozyg functionality is used for this purpose. We will run PLINK with appropriate parameters (e.g., minimum ROH length, number of SNPs, etc.) and output a file containing detailed information on ROH for each sample.",
